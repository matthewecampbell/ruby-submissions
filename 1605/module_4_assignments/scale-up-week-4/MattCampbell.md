"Dave, I love the enthralling conclusion.  I think you hit some good points of information on the differences since I didn’t know any and now have a better understanding just from reading your outline.  Maybe go into something a bit deeper than compiled and OOP?  Not sure what that would be." - Feed back for David on his Blog Post


"@ryanflach - in the first sentence, it’s a bit wordy.  Maybe end it after curriculum and don’t worry about mentioning the brownfield projects since it is still stuff outside of the general curriculum.  I would also mention why you are interested in Elixir/Phoenix.  I’m very curious to know why you landed on a functional programming language.  I think it would add a lot to the post."

### Work Completed

[My first commit with service workers](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/slime_volleyball/commit/0403e9516f572c4642eb3ceae537dc3dc7901745)

This is a bit of a test.  I wanted to see if I can start with the easiest iteration possible - using service-workers in a straight JavaScript Application.  Once I complete that I will move on to adding this to rails.  I am still waiting for my github pages to update so I can test my PR.
